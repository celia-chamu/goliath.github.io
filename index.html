                  I find myself at a loss for words each time I try to express the depth of my feelings for you. <br></br>
                  I really really really like you David. I don't know what you have done to me but thoughts of you fill my mind. <br></br>
                  It's more than just a passing infatuation;
                  Your presence fills my thoughts, <br></br> your laughter echoes in my mind, and your smile disarms me.
                  It's the way you view the world with a perspective that is uniquely your own. Your outlook on life is refreshing.<br></br>
                  You possess a patience and understanding that is rare and beautiful, and it's one of the many reasons why I admire you so deeply. I'm enamoured with your mind and soul. <br></br>David, you have a heart of gold. The kindness and compassion you show towards the people you care about is endearing.<br></br>
                  And then there's your passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. It's infectious, David.<br></br>
                  The way you light up when you're discussing something you're passionate aboutâ€”it's like watching the stars you sometimes go on about.<br></br> Your sense of fearlessness and adventure makes it exciting to be around you. I've told you this once and will tell you again but you are a truly unique person. <br></br>I have never met anyone like you, you're real special. <br></br>
                  It's hard not to fall in love with you.</p>
